## Ubuntu reinstallation scripts

* This repository contains a number of scripts intended to expedite reinstalling Ubuntu with my preferred configuration.

* Unlike the [Ubuntu modifications repository](https://github.com/danielrosehilljlm/UbuntuModifications) these scripts are obviously intended to be run within a terminal. That is to say, their purpose is to assist with the automatic installation and motification of components. 

My general workflow will be to:

a) Document changes to the default system state that I make in the Ubuntu modifications repository.
b) Add to the scripts in this repository to reflect those changes.

Thus, the changes to this repository will be downstream of [Ubuntu modifications](https://github.com/danielrosehilljlm/UbuntuModifications) and not vice versa.
